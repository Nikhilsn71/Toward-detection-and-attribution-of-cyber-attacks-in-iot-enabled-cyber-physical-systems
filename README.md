# Toward Detection and Attribution of Cyber Attacks in IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems

This project aims at enhancing the detection and attribution capabilities of cyber attacks within IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems. Leveraging Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Decision Trees (DT), and Autoencoder algorithms, we have achieved promising results in accurately identifying and attributing cyber attacks.

## Implementation
The project implementation revolves around the following key components:

**1. Data Collection:** Gathered datasets relevant to cyber-physical systems and cyber attacks.  <br>
**2. Data Analysis:** Analyzed collected data to understand patterns and anomalies.  <br>
**3. Data Preprocessing:** Prepared and cleaned data for feeding into the algorithms.  <br>
**4. Algorithm Integration:** Implemented DNN, DT, and Autoencoder algorithms for cyber attack detection and attribution.  <br>

## Framework
****Tkinter:**** Employed Tkinter framework for building the frontend interface, providing seamless interaction with the system.

## Usage

**1.** Ensure Python 3.7.2 is installed on your system.

**2.** Clone the repository:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/Nikhilsn71/Toward-detection-and-attribution-of-cyber-attacks-in-IoT-enabled-cyber-physical-systems.git
~~~

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.

**4.** Run the main Python script in cmd.
~~~
python main.py
~~~

## Results
****DNN Accuracy:**** 99%  <br>
****DT Accuracy:**** 90%  <br>
****Autoencoder Accuracy:**** 89%  <br>
